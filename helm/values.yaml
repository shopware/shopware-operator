# Enable event publishing when the store status resource is updated. This
# is useful if you want to add external applications which will wait until the
# operator is ready. Example event:

#     "type": "initializing",
#     "lastTransitionTime": null,
#     "lastUpdatedTime": "2025-07-07T14:00:52Z",
